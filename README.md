# SavingAndLoadingPackage
This is my first package, and template project for my implementation of saving, loading, and writing to files at runtime. This was developed for my game That Time I Left Home, and it was a very efficient method to create dialogue and narrative within the game, very easily. 
If you would like to use this for a project please email me at Oliverjones5124@gmail.com, and credit me, my website is Oliverjones.space . Thanks so much and happy devving!
